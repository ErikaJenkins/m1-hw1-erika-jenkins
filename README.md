##This is practice.

##I had issue with the following since this is my first time using Git. I wanted to look through the resources you provided plus videos on youtube and Lynda.com to figure this out. You learn alot by making errors and I learned alot with this assignment. I figure out how to do this in the repo but it was challenging to do it the terminal. I hope to connect with you to discuss this homework.

ISSUES
###issues with pull, pushing, merging
###connecting terminal with atom
###syncing between atom, terminal and my repo 
###commit vs pull vs push
###creating branches and snycing between the 3
###using atom with git
